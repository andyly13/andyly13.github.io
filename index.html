                        <br>"The best things in life are placed on the opposite side of fear"<br><br> Hi! My name is 
                        <a id="name" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-ly-770771208/">Andrew Ly</a>, 
                        and I am a second-year Business Information Management major studying at the University of 
                        California, Irvine. I am currently seeking opportunities to broaden my knowledge of the software
                         industry in hopes of eventually compiling enough skills to become a valuable product 
                         manager/software engineer and contribute to the success of my future team. 
                        I thrive in collaborative environments and find inspiration in being surrounded by individuals 
                        from whom I can learn. I believe in the power of building meaningful, enduring relationships 
                        and am always looking for opportunities to ask questions and learn something new!<br><br>
                        In my free time, I enjoy playing basketball, learning interesting new recipes, and 
                        procrastinating with a good self-help book...
